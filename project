    <h1>Origin of Lamborghini</h1>

    <p1> The first Lamborghinis were tractors, and they're still made today.
        Because of that WWII experience, when he got home he started piecing together tractors out of spare parts.
        People loved them, and his tractor business took off overnight. They're no longer part of the same company, but
        Lamborghini Trattori are still designed by the same firm that created the Gallardo and the Maserati MC12. They
        range in price from $30,000 to over $300,000 - the only question is, will your neighbor still give you credit
        for owning a Lambo? Lamborghini was founded because Ferrari used tractor clutches and had crummy customer
        service.
        Ferruccio famously owned a Ferrari 250GT, which he took in to be serviced at the Maranello headquarters after
        realizing that the clutch was identical to the one being used on his production line. He politely asked Enzo
        Ferrari for a replacement part, who replied "You're just a silly tractor manufacturer, how could you possibly
        know anything about sports cars?" Like any red blooded Italian, he spit on the floor, walked out and started
        designing his own sports car. Four months later he unveiled the Lamborghini 350GTV. Boss.Ferruccio Lamborghini
        was the original Tony Stark.
        During WWII, he was stationed on the isolated island of Rhodes as a vehicle maintenance supervisor for the
        Italian Royal Air Force. Needless to say being stuck on an island in the middle of a war makes it pretty tricky
        to secure spare parts, forcing Lamborghini to cobble together scraps to keep his machines running. He quickly
        earned the reputation of being a master mechanic, and an even more prolific tinkerer. Kind of like that time
        Tony Stark built a nuclear reactor in a cave. But real.
        The first Lamborghini didn't even have an engine when they unveiled it.
        The 350 GTV may have been the world's first Lambo, and ultimately, it led to the creation of the supercar genre,
        but when it was first unveiled at the Turin Auto Show it wasn't even finished, so they put a bunch of bricks
        where the engine should have been and kept the hood shut the entire time. And it was designed by the guy who
        builds IndyCars now.
        Gian Paolo Dallara did much of the Miura's chassis and engineering work, then went on to work in F1, before
        starting his own race engineering firm, which happens to build every single IndyCar chassis you see today.In the
        late 1960s, if you didn't own a Miura, you were nobody.Today, they're owned by people like Nicholas Cage and Jay
        Leno, but in the sixties Miuras were driven by people like Saudi King Fahd and Prince Faisal, Rod Stewart, Dean
        Martin, and Frank Sinatra, who famously said about his orange Miura with orange shag and wild boar skin seats:
        "You buy a Ferrari when you want to be somebody. You buy a Lamborghini when you are somebody. There was almost a
        Lamborghini Taurus.Ferruccio's birthday was April 28th, which meant he was a Taurus. That the constellation is
        in the shape of a bull is the reason Lamborghinis are named after bulls. It's a good thing he wasn't born in
        late February/early March or we could all be lusting after the Lamborghini Cichlid.

        <h2>Origin of Ferrari</h2>

        <p2>Our story officially begins in 1947 when the first car built under the Ferrari marque, the 125 S, drove
            through the historic factory gates on Via Abetone Inferiore in Maranello. That said, Ferrari’s origins are
            inextricably linked to its founder’s entire life story.
            Born in Modena on February 18 1898, Enzo Ferrari passed away on August 14 1988, having devoted his entire
            life to motor racing. He became an Alfa Romeo works driver in 1924 but just five years later set up the
            Scuderia Ferrari at Viale Trieste in Modena to allow its mostly gentleman driver members compete.
            In 1938, Ferrari was appointed head of Alfa Corse. However, he left in 1939 to start up Auto Avio
            Costruzioni in the Scuderia’s old headquarters.
            His new company founded, Enzo Ferrari built a sports car, a spider powered by a 1500 cc 8-cylinder engine.
            He called it the 815 and two were built. The car also took part in the 1940 Mille Miglia. Unfortunately, the
            outbreak of World War Two brought all motor racing to an abrupt end.
            In late 1943, Ferrari moved Auto Avio Costruzioni’s workshops from Modena to Maranello. At the end of the
            War, he set about designing and building what was to become the first Ferrari, the 125 S, a 1500cc
            12-cylinder. Franco Cortese drove the car in its maiden race at the Piacenza Circuit on May 11 1947 and
            again to its first victory in the Rome Grand Prix at the Terme di Caracalla circuit on the 25th of the same
            month.The 1950s brought major changes and by the end of the decade, the Ferrari name was famous all over the
            world.
            From a sporting perspective, the marque celebrated the first in a whole string of victories that would
            result in the Scuderia Ferrari becoming the most successful team in Formula 1 history.
            In endurance racing, Ferrari won its first Mille Miglia in 1948 and its first 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1949.
            In Formula 1, it took its first Formula 1 World Championship grand prix in 1951 and by 1952 had won the
            World title with Alberto Ascari, a feat it repeated in 1953.
            There were significant developments too on the production front as Ferrari began working with the historic
            Carrozzeria Scaglietti in 1951, commissioning it to fabricate and assemble its chassis’.
            All in all, the marque proved so successful with the public that sales more. </p2>

        <h3>Origin of Bugatti</h3>

        <p3>Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a French car manufacturer of high-performance automobiles,
            founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Mosheim, Alsace by the Italian-born industrial
            designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race
            victories. Famous Bugatti’s include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57
            "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car. The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end
            for the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 ensured there was not a successor
            to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled
            financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its
            airplane parts business in 1963.In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand and revived it
            as a builder of limited production exclusive sports cars based in Modena. In 1998,
            the Volkswagen Group bought the rights to the Bugatti marque and set up a subsidiary based back in Mosheim,
            Alsace.The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the
            Volkswagen Group and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti. It was
            named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron.
            The original version has a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph).[6][7] It was named Car of the Decade and best
            car award (2000–2009) by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Bugatti Veyron also won Top
            Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005.
            The Super Sport version of the Veyron is recognised by Guinness World Records as the fastest street-legal
            production car in the world, with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph).[8] The Veyron Grand Sport
            Vitesse was the fastest roadster in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in
            a test on 6 April 2013.[9][10]
            The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kabaň of Volkswagen,
            with much of the engineering work being conducted under the guidance of engineering chief Wolfgang
            Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester Audiosysteme.[11]
            Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers the
            ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application on the
            marque's official website.[12][13] The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition
            models continued to be produced until 2015.</p3>
